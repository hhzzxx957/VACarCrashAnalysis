# VACarCrashAnalysis
This project is to analyze Virginia car accident severity. The relationship between day time and crash severity is analyzed. The fatality of the accident is predicted by lightgbm. Feature importance of the fatality is extracted from Light gradient boosting decision trees.

## Data
Data is downloaded from Virginia Department of Transportation

## Code
The preprocess and classification is done by Python 3 and PySpark for comparison and testing, as shown in the JupyterNotebooks:
