# Virginia Car Crash Analysis
The project aims to analyze the severity of car accidents in Virginia. The relationship between day time and crash severity is illustrated. The fatality of the accident is predicted by factors like light condition, road condition, time ... through Light gradient boosting. Feature importance of the fatality is extracted from lightgbm decision trees.

## Data
Data is downloaded from Virginia Department of Transportation

## Code
The preprocess and classification is done by Python 3 and PySpark for comparison and testing, as shown in the JupyterNotebooks:
